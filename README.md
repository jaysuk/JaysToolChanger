# JaysToolChanger
Tool Changing 3D printer with a larger print volume and minimal machined parts.

![Printer](/JaysToolChanger/Printer_Design/Renders/Printer_View_1.JPG)

The design is pretty much completed and I am currently ordering and printing components.
I plan to have it built within the next couple of months or so.

# Design Goals
* Use the duet 3 board plus appropriate expansion boards
* Have direct drive tools
* Use a motor on the carriage for the tool changer (although this may be upgraded down the line to cable driven)
* Have 3 point levelling
* Have a minimal number of machined components (at the moment this stands at the bed and the locking pin).
* Design everything in Solidworks
* Stay E3D Tool compatible (my tools use 10mm balls but this wouldn't affect the tool changer)

# The todo list
These aren't in any particular order
* Design an exnclosure
* Add a method of wiping each tool
* Swap to the E3D Hermes when available
* Release duet config files
* Sort out electronics layout
* Update the bed model to include embedded magnets for swappable print surfaces
	
# Supplied Formats
The design will be supplied in the following file formats
* Solidworks - All files in native 2019 format. This is what I use to model everything
* Step - All files will be available as step. The assembly step files are segregated.
* STL - All printables
* 3MF - All printables
* PDF - Drawings for all machined parts

I welcome any feedback on this printer and will be working more on the design over the coming weeks.
