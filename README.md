# JaysToolChanger
Tool Changing 3D printer with a larger print volume and minimal machined parts.

The design is pretty much completed and I am currently ordering and printing components.
I plan to have it built within the next couple of months or so.

The design goals were as follows:
	- Use the duet 3 board plus appropriate expansion boards
	- Have direct drive tools
	- Use a motor on the carriage for the tool changer (although this may be upgraded down the line to cable driven)
	- Have 3 point levelling
	- Have a minimal number of machined components (at the moment this stands at the bed and the locking pin).
	- Design everything in Solidworks
	- Stay E3D Tool compatible (my tools use 10mm balls but this wouldn't affect the tool changer)

The todo list:
	- Design an exnclosure
	- Sort out tool wiping
	- Create a tool for the E3D Hermes when available
	- Release duet config files
	- Sort out electronics layout
	
I aim to provide the files in 4 different formats.
All files will be released as solidworks files and step files.
All 3D printable files will be released as STL and 3MF.
I will also release drawings for the Bed and Locking Pin.

I welcome any feedback on this printer and will be working more on the design over the coming weeks.
